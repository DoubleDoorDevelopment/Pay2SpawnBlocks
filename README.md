Pay2Spawn Blocks
================

Pay2Spawn trigger blocks!

* The texture is a placeholder, more fancy things to come. *

** \/ ACTUALLY READ THIS \/ **

Blocks break instantly when P2S is installed on your client, if not, you get a warning and they break much slower.

You need D3Core for this mod, but not P2S. That is the reason why this is a separate mod, so you don't need to put P2S in a pack, you only need this mod.

The chance to get a reward is inversely proportional to the cost of the reward.

Special rewards (with a cost <= 0.00$) are ignored!

This mod was made by request.
